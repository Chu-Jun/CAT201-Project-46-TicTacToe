If the downloaded images did not show on the game interface, you may continue with the steps below: 

Open the folder in any IDE that supports Java language. 

Go to “src” folder, copy the path of the 3 different images which are “TicTacToe.png”, “player1.png”, and “Player2.png” and paste them into necessary places in StartGame.java file. All the backward slash (\) must be changed to forward slash (/). 

Next, copy the path of the “O_image.png” and “X_image.png” and paste them into necessary places in TicTacToeGUI.java file. All the backward slash (\) must be changed to forward slash (/). 

Save the files and now you can run the StartGame java class to start the program successfully.
